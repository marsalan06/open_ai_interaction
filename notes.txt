This code is creating a simple chatbot interface using the OpenAI API and the Gradio library. 
The chatbot uses the GPT-3.5-turbo model provided by OpenAI to generate responses to user input.


The openai module is imported and the API key is set to authenticate the use of the OpenAI API.


The messages variable is initialized with a single message, which is the introductory message from 
the chatbot.

The chatbot function is defined, which takes an input text from the user and generates a response 
using the OpenAI API. The input text is added to the messages list along with a "user" role. 
The openai.ChatCompletion.create() method is used to generate a response from the GPT-3.5-turbo 
model based on the current conversation history stored in messages. The response is then 
added to the messages list with an "assistant" role. The response is returned from the function.


The gradio module is imported to create the interface. A gr.Interface object is created with the 
chatbot function as the function to be called when the user interacts with the interface. 
The input widget is a textbox where the user can type their message. The output widget is 
also a textbox where the response is displayed. The title, description, and theme of the 
interface are also specified. Finally, the launch() method is called to start the interface, 
which can be shared online by setting the share parameter to True.
